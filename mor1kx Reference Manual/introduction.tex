\section{Purpose}
The Write Back Cache Implementation Reference Manual for the mor1kx embedded processor is intended to describe how the original architecture has been modified in order to provide the cache's write policy known as \textit{write-back}.

This document aims to supply an adequate knowledge to those developers and programmers, who have to change, adjust and enhance for any reason the related Verilog HDL code, making the understanding of what has been implemented much easier.

\section{Scope}
The mor1kx is an open source, Verilog implementation that is fully compliant with the OpenRisc architecture. In its \textit{Cappuccino} fashion, it offers a six stages pipeline with \textit{write-through} L1 caches.

The following sections deal with all the adjustments required to offer the more aggressive \textit{write-back} writing policy with respect to the \textit{Cappuccino} pipeline only.
